Therapists lack a dedicated, secure online space for professional connection and collaboration, distinct from public social media. TheraRoot solves this by providing a full-stack MERN web application designed as a private network exclusively for mental health professionals. It offers a dedicated space to connect, collaborate, share resources, and build a supportive professional community.

## Project Overview üíô

In today's digital world, therapists need a private and professional environment to network and collaborate. TheraRoot was built to be this solution. It's a feature-rich platform where therapists can find and connect with colleagues based on specific criteria (location, specialties, modalities), engage in meaningful discussions within specialized communities, share resources, chat in real-time, and manage their professional profile. The application features a real-time chat system, dynamic forum capabilities, and a fully responsive design for a seamless experience on any device.
